               <p>It's best to dress the table the <strong><em>night 
before Christmas</em></strong>. Why? So you have plenty of time to hunt
down missing cutlery and crockery, to check glasses are free of 
watermarks, and it also means you won't be thrown off if your guests 
arrive early.
Not only that, but by preparing your table early it allows you more 
time to think about an overhead display, like these hanging paper 
decorations, or dressing the shelves and surfaces in the room to create
a beautiful ambience.

                 When you choose a theme for your table, you can 
really do as much or as little as you like. It could be you simply 
<strong><em>choose one key colour</em></strong>to pick up in your 
tablecloth, napkins and table arrangement, or you may want to go all 
out with <strong><em>a specific look</em></strong>, whether it's 
nature-inspired with lots of wood and greenery, or Art Deco opulence, 
such as this table above.
 
 From peacock feathers and gold-sprayed fruit, to earthy colours and 
Scandic-style decorations, the world is your oyster. So get creative 
and come up with a theme that not only suits your home, but calls to 
your imagination, too.

                   Layering your table is key, so decide if you're 
using a tablecloth or runner (or both), then pop a charger or beaded 
placemat for each place setting, topped with your choice of crockery 
and bowls.
                   When it comes to your napkin, decide if you want to
make a feature of it with some serious Christmas napkin folding 
<strong><em>origami</em></strong> (bows and Christmas tree designs are 
easy to fold), or whether you'd rather use <strong><em>an ornate napkin
ring</em></strong> as shown above.

                   Depending on the size of the table, you might 
already be struggling to fit on all your glasses and crockery. If 
that's the case, avoid cluttering it up further with tealights and 
other decorations. However, it's always worth squeezing in a Christmas 
table centrepiece idea. Just remember, <strong><em>bigger doesn't 
necessarily mean better</em></strong>.
                   A long planter with pillar candles nestled into 
moss keeps things simple, and the shape works well with a standard 
rectangular-shaped dining table.

                   Welcome your loved ones to the table with a 
handwritten place setting. This could be as simple as a card, or you 
could double up and create small gifts for your guests. Perhaps a small
succulent with a chalkboard label bearing their name? Or a personalised
bauble or cracker? Feel free to let your imagination run wild – just 
make sure, whatever you settle on, that <strong><em>it works with your 
overall theme</em></strong>.
                   Oh, and one last thing – before everyone sits down 
to eat, make sure you share your carefully laid table with the world! 
Take a quick snap for Instagram, and add the hashtag #tablescape so 
that others can seek out your scheme for inspiration. It's also a good 
term to search with if you're looking for ideas.
